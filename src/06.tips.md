# Tips

This SDK is not only useful for communicating with MyParcel, but also contains code that you can take advantage of
yourself.

## Collections

If you use arrays a lot, Collections are usually better to work with.

## Other helpers

- `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Arr` [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#arrays)
- `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Str` [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#method-camel-case)
