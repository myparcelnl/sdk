# Using multiple carriers

It is possible to use multiple carriers. The following carriers are supported:

| ID  | Name          | Carrier class                        | Consignment class                            |
| --- | ---           | ---                                  | ---                                          |
| 1   | PostNL        | `Model\Carrier\CarrierPostNL`        | `Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment`        |
| 2   | Bpost         | `Model\Carrier\CarrierBpost`         | `Model\Consignment\BpostConsignment`         |
| 3   | DPD           | `Model\Carrier\CarrierDPD`           | `Model\Consignment\DPDConsignment`           |
| 5   | Instabox | `Model\Carrier\CarrierInstabox` | `Model\Consignment\InstaboxConsignment` |

Please note, Instabox is only available in the Netherlands as of now, and can only ship to Dutch addresses. You can
query which carriers are available like this:

```php
$options = (new CarrierOptionsWebService())
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
    ->getCarrierOptions('shop_id');
```

You can get the required `shop_id` from `AccountWebService`, the only shop returned will be the shop belonging to the
API key that is used. Since the `shop_id` will not change unless the API key changes, we advise you to store
the `shop_id` until the user updates the API key.

```php
$shop_id = (new AccountWebService())
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
    ->getAccount()
    ->getShops()
    ->first()
    ->getId();
```

#### Create a consignment for each carrier manually:

```php
$postNL        = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment();
$bpost         = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\BpostConsignment();
$dpd           = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\DPDConsignment();
$instabox = new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\Model\Consignment\InstaboxConsignment();
```

Or by using `Factory\ConsignmentFactory` with a carrier ID or name, making it easier to dynamically instantiate a
consignment:

```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Factory\ConsignmentFactory;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Carrier\CarrierBpost;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Carrier\CarrierPostNL;

$postNL = ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(CarrierPostNL::getId());
$bpost  = ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierName(CarrierBpost::getName());
```
