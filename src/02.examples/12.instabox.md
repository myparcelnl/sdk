# Filling in required drop-off point for Instabox

Instabox requires a drop-off point be added to each consignment. Get available drop off points from the webservice.
It will return an indexed array holding data from drop off points near the supplied postalcode.

```php
$dropOffPoints = (new DropOffPointWebService(new CarrierInstabox()))
      ->setApiKey('api_key_from_backoffice')
      ->getDropOffPoints('valid_dutch_postal_code');
```

You can use these to select a preferred drop off point. The `location_code` field provides a unique identifier.

Please note:

- The list for a given postal code may be empty when there are no drop off points available in the vicinity.
- The user may have indicated a default drop off point in the backoffice, check `default_drop_off_point` field for each
  drop off point in the array.

Create a DropOffPoint using the relevant fields returned for the selected drop off point. Then set it on the
consignment, which should be an otherwise valid Instabox consignment.

```php
$dropOffPoint = (new DropOffPoint())
    ->setBoxNumber()                            // unused for dutch addresses
    ->setCc('NL')                               // country code (field: cc) returned for the drop off point
    ->setCity('Amsterdam')                      // city (field: city)
    ->setLocationCode('location_code')          // field: location_code holds a unique id for the drop off point
    ->setLocationName('location_name')          // name of the drop off point (field: location_name)
    ->setStreet('Plein 1945')                   // street (field: street)
    ->setNumber(55)                             // number (field: number)
    ->setNumberSuffix('b')                      // number suffix (field: number_suffix)
    ->setPostalCode('2231JE')                   // postal code (field: postal_code)
    ->setRegion()                               // unused for dutch addresses
    ->setRetailNetworkId('retail_network_id')   // maybe used later
    ->setState();                               // unused for dutch addresses

$consignment->setDropOffPoint($dropOffPoint);
```

The consignment can now be created, refer to [create a consignment](./01.create-consignment.md).
