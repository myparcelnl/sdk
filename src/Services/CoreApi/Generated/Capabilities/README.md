# Generated Code â€“ Do Not Edit

This directory contains auto-generated client code from the MyParcel Core API OpenAPI specification (Capabilities v2).

## Important Warning

**DO NOT modify these files manually!** Any manual changes will be overwritten when the code is regenerated.

## Regenerating the Client

To update the generated client code:

1. Ensure you have Yarn installed: `yarn --version`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Regenerate the client: `composer generate:capabilities`

## What's Generated

- API client classes (`lib/Api/`)
- Model classes including enums (`lib/Model/`)
- Configuration and helper classes
- 

In the future, this directory will not be committed to Git. Instead:
- Generated code will be created during GitHub Actions release builds
- The generated code will be included in published Composer packages
- The `main` branch will remain clean of generated files
