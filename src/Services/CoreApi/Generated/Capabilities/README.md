# Generated Code â€“ Do Not Edit

This directory contains auto-generated client code for the **MyParcel Core API** (Capabilities v2), generated via **Swagger Codegen v3** in a Docker container.

---

## Important Warning

**DO NOT modify these files manually!**  
Any manual changes will be overwritten when the client is regenerated.

---

## Regenerating the Client

To update the generated client code:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed
2. Regenerate the client using Composer (this runs Swagger Codegen in Docker):
   ```
   composer generate:capabilities
   ```
3. Re-dump the autoloader if needed:
   ```
   composer dump-autoload -o
   ```

## What's Generated

- API client classes (`lib/Api/`)
- Model and enum classes (`lib/Model/`)
- Configuration and helper classes (`lib/Configuration.php`, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

- **Generator**: swaggerapi/swagger-codegen-cli-v3:3.0.57
- **Specification source**: https://api.myparcel.nl/openapi.yaml
- **Output path**: `src/Services/CoreApi/Generated/Capabilities/lib/`

## CI/CD

In future releases, generated code may be produced automatically in GitHub Actions and distributed only through published Composer packages. The main branch should remain clean of regenerated artifacts.
