## Installation

### Requirements
The MyParcel SDK works with PHP version >= 7.1.0.

If you have a php version lower than 7.1.0 then we would like to advise you to update your PHP version to a [supported versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).
For support for PHP version 5.6 you can use release [2.x.](https://github.com/myparcelnl/sdk/releases).

### Installation with Composer
This SDK uses Composer. Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. For more information on how to use/install composer, please visit https://getcomposer.org/

To install the MyParcel SDK into your project, simply use
```
$ composer require myparcelnl/sdk
```
	
### Installation without Composer
It's also possible to use the SDK without installing it with Composer.

You can download the zip on the project's [releases page](https://github.com/myparcelnl/sdk/releases).

1. Download the package (SDKvx.x.x.zip).
2. Extract the downloaded .zip file and upload the vendor directory to your server.
3. Require `src/AutoLoader.php`
4. You can now use the SDK in your project!

## Quick start and examples
Add the following lines to your project to import the SDK classes for creating shipments.
```php
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Factory\ConsignmentFactory;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Helper\MyParcelCollection;
use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment;
```

### Create a consignment
This example uses only the required methods to create a shipment and download its label.

```php
$consignment = (ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
    ->setApiKey('api_key_from_MyParcel_backoffice')
    ->setReferenceId('Order 146')
    ->setCountry('NL')
    ->setPerson('Piet Hier')
    ->setFullStreet('Plein 1945 55b')
    ->setPostalCode('2231JE')
    ->setCity('Amsterdam')
    ->setEmail('piet.hier@test.nl');
    
$consignments = (new MyParcelCollection())
    ->addConsignment($consignment)
    ->setPdfOfLabels();

$consignmentId = $consignments->first()->getConsignmentId();

$consignments->downloadPdfOfLabels();
```

### Create multiple consignments
This example creates multiple consignments by adding them to one ```MyParcelCollection()``` and then creates and downloads one PDF with all labels.

```php
// Create the collection before the loop
$consignments = (new MyParcelCollection())
    ->setUserAgent('name_of_cms', '1.0'); 

// Loop through your shipments, adding each to the same MyParcelCollection()
foreach ($yourShipments as $yourShipment) {

    $consignment = ((ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId(PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))
        ->setApiKey('api_key_from_MyParcel_backoffice')
        ->setReferenceId($yourShipment['reference_id'])
        ->setPerson($yourShipment['name'])
        ->setPostalCode($yourShipment['postal_code'])
        ->setFullStreet($yourShipment['full_street']) 
        ->setCity($yourShipment['city']);
        
    // Add each consignment to the collection created before
    $consignments
        ->addConsignment($consignment);
}
```

### Different carriers
It is possible to use multiple carriers, for this you need to use:\
`((ConsignmentFactory::createByCarrierId (PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID))`

The following carriers are supported:
- PostNL: `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment::CARRIER_ID`
- bpost: `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\BpostConsignment::CARRIER_ID`
- DPD: `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\DPDConsignment::CARRIER_ID`

For this, you need to add the following lines to your project:
- PostNL: `use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment;`
- bpost: `use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\BpostConsignment;`
- DPD: `use MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\DPDConsignment;`

### Label format and position
Choose to output the label as either A4 or A6 when creating a pdf or download link with the argument `$positions` of `setPdfOfLabels($positions)` and `setLinkOfLabels($positions)`.

Example values for `$positions`:
```
A4:            A6:
┏━━━━━┳━━━━━┓  ┏━━━━━┓
┃  1  ┃  2  ┃  ┃  x  ┃
┣━━━━━╋━━━━━┫  ┗━━━━━┛
┃  3  ┃  4  ┃
┗━━━━━┻━━━━━┛  
```
1. `1`: Default value. Outputs A4, starting at top left position.
1. `false`: Outputs at A6 format
1. `[1,4]`: Defines the position of labels on an A4 sheet. Only applies to the first page, subsequent pages will use the default positioning (1,2,3,4)

More information: https://myparcelnl.github.io/api/#6_F

### Package type and options
Set package type with `setPackageType($type)`. Retrieve it after with `getPackageType()`. For more details on the different types of packages: https://myparcelnl.github.io/api/#6_A_1

#### 1: Package
This is the default package type. It must be explicitly set to allow enabling of further shipment options. It's available for NL, EU and global shipments.

#### 2: Mailbox package
This package type is only available for NL shipments that fit into a mailbox. It does not support additional options.
Note: If you still make the request with additional options, bear in mind that you need to pay more than is necessary!

#### 3: Letter 
This package type is available for NL, EU and global shipments. The label for this shipment is unpaid meaning that you will need to pay the postal office/courier to send this letter/package. Therefore, it does not support additional options.

#### 4: Digital stamp 
This package type is only available for NL shipments and does not support any additional options. Its price is calculated using the package weight, which is set using `setPhysicalProperties()`.

```php
    ->setPackageType(4)
    ->setPhysicalProperties(['weight' => 300]); // weight in grams (required)
```

> Note: This shipment will appear on your invoice on shipment_status 2 (pending - registered) instead of all other shipment types, which don't appear until shipment status 3. Read more: https://myparcelnl.github.io/api/#6_A_1

#### Package options
These options are only available for package type 1 (package).

Available options:
- only_recipient: Deliver the package only at address of the intended recipient. This option is required for Morning and Evening delivery types.
  - Set: `setOnlyRecipient(true)`
  - Get: `isOnlyRecipient()`
- signature: Recipient must sign for the package. This option is required for Pickup delivery type.
  - Set: `setSignature(true)`
  - Get: `isSignature()`
- return: Return the package to the sender when the recipient is not home.
  - Set: `setReturn(true)`
  - Get: `isReturn()`
- large_format: This option must be specified if the dimensions of the package are between 100 x 70 x 50 and 175 x 78 x 58 cm. If the scanned dimensions from the carrier indicate that this package is large format and it has not been specified then it will be added to the shipment in the billing process. This option is also available for EU shipments.
  - Set: `setLargeFormat(true)`
  - Get: `isLargeFormat()`
- age_check: The Customer/Consumer must sign for the package and only receive it when he is at least 18 years.
    - Set: `setAgeCheck(true)`
    - Get: `hasAgeCheck()`
- insurance: This option allows a shipment to be insured up to certain amount. NL shipments can be insured for 5000,- euros. EU shipments must be insured for 500,- euros. Global shipments must be insured for 200,- euros. The following shipment options are mandatory when insuring an NL shipment: only_recipient and signature.
  - Set: `setInsurance(250)` (amount in EUR)
  - Get: `getInsurance()`

### Find consignments
After creating consignments, it is often necessary to pick up a specific consignment:
```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::find(432345);
```
Instead of `find()` you can also use `findMany()`, `findByReferenceId()` or `findManyByReferenceId()`.

For `reference identifier` you can use a `*` to search smarter:
```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::findByReferenceId('your-label-*');
```

### Query consignments
You can search and filter consignments by certain values:
```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::query(
            'api_key_from_MyParcel_backoffice',
            [
                'q'                    => 'Niels',
                'reference_identifier' => 'order-1234',
                'status'               => 2,
                'from'                 => '2020-01-01 00:00:00',
                'to'                   => '2020-02-01 00:00:00',
                'page'                 => 1,
                'size'                 => 200,
                'order'                => 'DESC',
                'package_type'         => 1,
                'region'               => 'NL;EU',
                'dropoff_today'        => 1,
            ]
        )
```
For `q` and `reference identifier` you can use `*` to search smarter.
> If the 2nd parameter is an object, then public properties will be used. If you query in many ways, creating a separate class can provide a clean solution.

More information: https://myparcelnl.github.io/api/#6_E.

### Retrieve data from a consignment
Most attributes that have a set...() method also have a get...() method to retrieve the data. View [all methods](#PostNLConsignment) for consignments here. 
```php
$consignment = new PostNLConsignment();

echo $consignment->getFullStreet();
echo $consignment->getPerson();
echo $consignment->getPhone();
echo $consignment->getStreet();
// etc...
```

#### Get status
After ```setPdfOfLabels()```, ```setLinkOfLabels()``` and ```createConcepts()``` you can get the status.
```php
$status = $consignment->getStatus();
```

#### Get barcode
The barcode is available after ```setPdfOfLabels()``` and ```setLinkOfLabels()```
```php
$barcode = $consignment->getBarcode();
```

#### Get Track & Trace url
The Track & Trace url is available after `downloadPdfOfLabels()` and `getLinkOfLabels()`
```php
$consignment = (new \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Model\Consignment\PostNLConsignment());
echo $consignment->getBarcodeUrl(3SMYPA123456789, '2231JE', 'NL'); // Barcode , Postal code, Country
```

### Create and download label(s)
Create and directly download PDF with `setPdfOfLabels($position)` where `$positions` is the [label position](#label-format-and-position) value. 
```php
$consignments
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels(false); // Opens pdf "inline" by default, pass false as argument to download file  
```

Create and echo download link to PDF with `setLinkOfLabels($position)` where `$positions` is the [label position](#label-format-and-position) value.
If you want more than 25 labels in one response, the setLinkOfLabels will automatically use a different endpoint. At that point, it is likely that the PDF is not ready yet. You should check periodically if the PDF is ready for download.
```php
echo $consignments 
    ->setLinkOfLabels($positions)
    ->getLinkOfLabels();
```

If you want to download a label at a later time, you can also use the following to fill the collection:
```php
$consignments = MyParcelCollection::findByReferenceId('999999', 'api_key_from_MyParcel_backoffice');
$consignments
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels();
```
Instead of `findByReferenceId()` you can also use `findManyByReferenceId()`, `find()` or `findMany()`.

```php
  ->setAmount(3) // Amount of items in the package
  
  // ISIC/IDEP code (https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/deelnemers-enquetes/deelnemers-enquetes/bedrijven/onderzoek/lopend/internationale-handel-in-goederen/idep-codelijsten) 
  ->setClassification(0111) // Example: 0111 = "Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds"

  ->getCountry()
  ->getDescription()
  ->getItemValue()
  ->getWeight()
  
  ->isFullyFilledItem()
```

### Helpers
```MyParcelNL/Sdk/src/Helper```

#### MyParcelCollection
Stores all consignments to communicate with the MyParcel API.
MyParcelCollection also contains almost [all methods](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/collections) from Laravel Collections. If you use Laravel it also extends \Illuminate\Support\Collection.

```MyParcelNL/Sdk/src/Helper/MyParcelCollection.php```
```php
    ->addConsignment() // Add consignment to collection

    // Get consignments from the collection
    ->getConsignments()
    ->getConsignmentByApiId()
    ->getConsignmentsByReferenceId()

    // Clear the collection
    ->clearConsignmentsCollection()

    // Create or delete concept shipments in the MyParcel Backoffice
    ->createConcepts()
    ->deleteConcepts()
    
    ->getOneConsignment()
    ->getRequestBody()
    
    ->sendReturnLabelMails() // Send return label to customer. The customer can pay and download the label
    ->setLatestData() // Set id and run this function to update all the information about this shipment
    
    ->setLinkOfLabels()
    ->getLinkOfLabels()

    // Refer to 
    ->setPdfOfLabels()
    ->downloadPdfOfLabels()
    
    // To give us insight into which CMS system you're connecting from, you should send a User-Agent. 
    // If you're using a known CMS system it's required. 
    // You must send the name of the CMS system (required) followed by a version number (optional).
    ->setUserAgent('name_of_cms', '1.0')
    ->getUserAgent()
```

### Delivery options from the checkout with adapters

You can use DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory if you use the following code in your checkout: https://github.com/myparcelnl/checkout
You can use these adapters to receive the options anywhere in your code in a consistent way. If you also have the options in a different format (for example $order['signature']), you can also make your own adapter.

```
try {
	// Create new instance from known json
	$deliveryOptions = MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Factory\DeliveryOptionsAdapterFactory::create(json_decode($dataFromCheckout));
} catch (BadMethodCallException $e) {
	// Create new instance from your own data
	$deliveryOptions = new DeliveryOptionsFromOrderAdapter(null, (array) $meta);
}
```
Adapters are independent of consignments. It is therefore your responsibility to transform an adapter into a consignment.


## Exceptions

MyParcel uses several types of Exceptions to make the errors clear. It is your responsibility to provide the correct status in a response.
These are the Exceptions that we currently use:

#### InvalidConsignmentException
Exception to be returned when an address is incorrect or not usable.

Class: `MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Exception\InvalidConsignmentException`

HTTP status: 412

#### ApiException
Exception to be returned when a call to MyParcel services has failed.

Class: `MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Exception\ApiException`

HTTP status: 502

#### MissingFieldException
Exception thrown when there is an attempt to dynamically access a field that does not exist.

Class: `MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Exception\MissingFieldException`

HTTP status: 500

#### InvalidArgumentException
Exception thrown if an argument is not the expected type.

Class: `\InvalidArgumentException`

HTTP status: 500

#### BadMethodCallException
Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method or if some arguments are missing.

Class: `\BadMethodCallException:`

HTTP status: 500

## Tips
This SDK is not only useful for communicating with MyParcel. This package also contains code that you can take advantage of yourself:

### Collections
If you use arrays a lot, Collections are usually better to work with. ([documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/collections))
\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Collection()

### Helpers
* \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Arr ([documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#arrays))
* \MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Support\Str ([documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#method-camel-case))
* `\MyParcelNL\Sdk\src\Helper\SplitStreet::splitStreet('Plein 1940-45 3b'))`
